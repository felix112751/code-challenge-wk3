### Concert Management System
#### Overview
The Concert Management System is a Python application designed to manage and track concerts, bands, and venues using a SQLite database. It provides functionality to handle the relationships between bands, venues, and concerts, allowing users to query data and perform various operations related to concerts.

#### Features
Manage bands, venues, and concerts.
Query concerts to find out if they are in the band's hometown.
Retrieve information about bands, venues, and their concerts.
Perform aggregate queries to find the band with the most performances or the most frequent band at a venue.
Insert and manage sample data for testing purposes.

#### Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone 
cd concert-management
Install Dependencies

If you are using a virtual environment, create and activate it:

bash
Copy code :https://github.com/felix112751/code-challenge-wk3
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: requirements.txt should include sqlite3 (which is included by default with Python) or any other packages if needed.

Setup Database

Ensure that the database schema is created. Run the following script to initialize the database:

python
Copy code
python db.py
This script will create the necessary tables and insert sample data.
